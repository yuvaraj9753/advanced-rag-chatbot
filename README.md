📚 Advanced RAG Chatbot

An intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that enables users to upload a PDF document, ask natural language questions, generate AI-powered document summaries, and explore document chunks through an interactive interface.

Built using Python, LangChain, FAISS, Sentence Transformers, Groq Llama-3, and Streamlit, this project demonstrates an end-to-end RAG pipeline with a clean user experience and modular architecture.

🚀 Features

📄 PDF Upload

- Upload a PDF document through an intuitive interface.
- Displays uploaded file name and file size.

⚡ Intelligent Processing Pipeline

The application processes every uploaded PDF using multiple stages:

- PDF Loading
- Text Chunking
- Embedding Generation
- FAISS Vector Store Creation
- Retrieval Initialization

A live progress indicator keeps users informed throughout the processing workflow.

---

📊 Document Statistics

Displays useful information immediately after processing:

- Total Pages
- Total Chunks
- Embedding Model
- Vector Database
- LLM Model
- Processing Time

---

💬 AI Chat with PDF

Ask questions in natural language.

The system:

- Retrieves relevant document chunks
- Builds contextual prompts
- Generates accurate answers using Groq Llama-3
- Maintains short-term conversation memory
- Displays document sources used for every answer

---

📄 AI Document Summary

Generate an AI-powered summary of the uploaded document.

The summary includes:

- Overview
- Key Points
- Important Information
- Conclusion

---

🧩 Chunk Explorer

Explore how the document is divided internally.

For every chunk, the application displays:

- Chunk Number
- Page Number
- Character Count
- Word Count
- Complete Chunk Content

This feature helps users understand the internal working of Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

---

📚 Source Citation

Every generated answer includes document source information to improve transparency.

---

💾 FAISS Index Caching

Previously processed documents automatically reuse stored FAISS indexes, reducing processing time significantly.

---

🧠 Conversation Memory

Maintains recent conversation history to improve follow-up questions without requiring a database.
